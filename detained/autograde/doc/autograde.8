.PP
The \fIspec/\fR directory contains, for each course and program number, two
files: a Piraha grammar file and a grading scheme file.  The grammar file
contains rules for parsing items.  Rules are defined as:

.PP 
rulename = \fIexpr\fR

.PP 
where expr is a Piraha expression.  Grading scheme files contain rules 
for assigning point values to the grading item if the text for a corresponding rule is successfully parsed.  Grading scheme rules are defined like so:

.PP 
2: rulename; "Comment"
