A note on the folders here:

 + **developing** means it is actively being developed, but not
   ready for publication in its own repository.

 + **detained** means it was completed, but is not substantial
   enough work to warrant its own repository.

 + **defunct** means it is broken and no longer working; it has
   been abandoned, but retained for records.

 + **deferred** means it has been put on hold, and will be
   developed at a later time.
